      10 Personal Development Books Every Student Should Read
    </h1>
    <p class="book-blog-introduction">
      It’s safe to say that personal development books have a bit of a bad
      reputation. What comes to mind are diet books that promise you’ll lose
      25 pounds in 2 weeks without having to exercise. Or perhaps spiritual or
      relationship books that’ll help you find love in 17 easy steps. Sure,
      there are books like these filling entire shelves in bookstores and
      libraries, but not all self-help or self-development books are created
      equal. <br /><br />
      In school, we are encouraged to read the great literary
      classics—Shakespeare, Orwell, Austen, etc. While these are absolute
      must-reads for any avid reader, there’s also a case to be made for
      reading books that encourage you to live a fuller, richer, and more
      meaningful life. After all, personal development books are just that:
      books that help you to develop into the person you want to be. There’s
      no better time to start reading books that help you become the best,
      happiest, most successful version of yourself than while still at
      school. <br /><br />
      That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top 10 personal development
      books every student should read. Even if you read just one of them,
      you’ll take away a few lessons that could stay with you for the rest of
      your life.

      1. Small Move, Big Change <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Caroline Arnold</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Have you ever promised yourself that this school year you won’t leave
      writing your term paper until the last minute, just to forget about your
      resolution as soon as term started? Why did you struggle to stick to
      your new resolution? <br /><br />
      Caroline Arnold dives into this question in her book, Small Move, Big
      Change, discovering that most of us fail at keeping our resolutions
      because they are too vague and too big. <br /><br />
      By incorporating ‘microresolutions,’ tiny behavioural modifications,
      into our daily habits, we can achieve lasting change in virtually any
      area of our lives. It all comes down to identifying our habits and
      external cues that can be linked to tiny resolutions that stick because
      they are so easy to achieve. This is an essential read for anyone
      wanting to change their habits.

      2. The Last Lecture
      <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Randy Pausch</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      What would you talk about if you knew you only had a few months left?
      That’s the question Professor Randy Pausch had to answer a month after
      being diagnosed with terminal cancer. <br /><br />
      This booked is based on his now iconic lecture, called “Really Achieving
      Your Childhood Dreams” and challenges his students and readers to think
      back to their own childhood dreams, and what their biggest hopes and
      desires for their life were then.
      <br /><br />
      While he doesn’t suggest you join the circus or try to become an
      astronaut, he urges you to pursue the life you truly desire, without
      limiting yourself to the constraints of society or what you’re “supposed
      to do.”
      <br /><br />
      The book complements the lecture with added stories from Pausch’s own
      childhood that he wanted to pass on to his children.

      3. The Happiness Project <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Gretchen Rubin</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Since publishing this bestselling book, Gretchen Rubin has become known
      as somewhat of a happiness expert. Most people agree that the most
      important thing in life is to strive for happiness, and most parents
      would even say their biggest hope for their kids it that they are happy.
      So how come prioritising our own happiness is so often seen as selfish
      in today’s world? <br /><br />
      After realising that she wasn’t as happy as she should be, considering
      her life was going pretty well, Rubin decided to study happiness and
      dedicated a whole year of her life to her “happiness project.” She
      focused on 12 different areas of her life and methodically tracked
      habits and behaviours that increased her happiness. While “everyone’s
      happiness project will be different,” Rubin gives readers a blueprint to
      create their own happiness.
      <br /><br />
      This is essential reading for everyone who wants to actively understand
      what makes them happy and how they can improve their life according to
      their values of happiness.

      4. Failing Forward: Turning Mistakes into Stepping Stones for Success
      <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by John C. Maxwell</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      We are taught early on to avoid failure at all costs. You don’t want to
      be a loser, right? But the truth is that everyone fails at some point in
      their life. The question isn’t whether we will fail, but how we will
      deal with our failures? John C. Maxwell writes: “When achievers fail,
      they see it as a momentary event, not a lifelong epidemic.” <br /><br />
      Only by owning up to and learning from our failures can we grow as
      people, in business and in relationships. The most successful people
      have failed over and over again. James Dyson invented 5,126 prototypes
      before he built his first commercially successful vacuum cleaner. He
      used his failures as stepping stones towards success. This book will
      teach you to observe your failures, analyse them, and learn from them.

      5. The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind
      <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Alan Wallace</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Never have we been surrounded by more technology fighting to grab our
      attention than now. Smart phones, social media, notifications, the
      average attention span of a human has shrunk to that of the notoriously
      unfocused gold fish. There are even apps created to helping us with our
      lack of focus, adding another layer of distraction to our everyday
      lives.
      <br /><br />
      In The Attention Revolution, Wallace shares some techniques to attain
      the highest form of Shamatha, a Buddhist meditation state of mind. While
      it’s near impossible to achieve in just one lifetime, using some of the
      lessons shared, you will be able to take control of your attention
      again, to focus on anything you set your mind to, whether you’re
      studying for an exam, or practicing a hobby or sport.

      6. Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by David Allen</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Granted, the title of this book might not capture your imagination, but
      if you read one book about productivity in your life, then make it this
      one. <br /><br />
      The basic principle behind the Getting Things Done, or GTD method, is
      the idea that you should get all your thoughts and tasks out of your
      mind so they don’t clutter your headspace. First, apply the 2-minute
      rule. If a task takes less than 2 minutes to complete, do it now. If it
      takes longer, follow a simple five-step workflow: capture, clarify,
      organise, reflect, and engage. By following these two principles you can
      virtually take control of all projects and tasks in your life. Sound
      simple? That’s because it is. You can start applying it to school work,
      hobbies, and any other projects right away.
      <br /><br />
      While the original book was published in 2001, Allen has kept it updated
      and relevant to today’s busy and noisy world of multi-tasking, email,
      and social media.

      7. The 4-Hour Workweek <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Tim Ferriss</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Since its publication in 2007, The <i> 4-Hour Workweek</i> has been
      heavily criticised by some, while becoming something of a business and
      lifestyle bible for others. The main premise is that the traditional
      concept of retirement, deferred gratification, and the 9-to-5 is
      outdated and that there’s no reason to wait until you’re old to enjoy
      yourself, especially in these difficult economic times. <br /><br />
      While the title can be somewhat misleading, there are many valuable
      lessons to be learned. Ferriss shares how he managed to reduce his
      working hours to just 4 per week by automating and outsourcing large
      chunks of his business, while increasing his income from $40,000 per
      year to $40,000 per month.
      <br /><br />
      Even if you’re not interested in becoming an entrepreneur, you’ll learn
      about productivity, time management, and learning techniques—and most
      importantly, the concept of lifestyle design and how you can take
      control over what your life looks like.

    <h3 class="book-blog-book-heading">
      8. Lean In <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Sheryl Sandberg</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Celebrated as a modern feminist manifesto, Sandberg’s book Lean In
      should be essential reading for both female and male students. The chief
      operating officer at Facebook and former Google executive shares her own
      experiences as well as those of other women in high corporate positions,
      encouraging women to “lean in” and claim their seat at the table.
      Instead of simply bemoaning the current state of affairs, she gives
      concrete advice on how women can break the limiting patterns they face
      in the working world. Don’t check out of your career early just because
      you’re planning to have kids, find a partner who is willing to support
      your career, forget the unrealistic concept of “having it all,” and
      start taking more risks. Both men and women will find invaluable lessons
      in leadership that will help you maneuver your future career.
      <br /><br />
      In her latest book,<i> Lean In for Graduates</i> Sandberg has added a
      few chapters specific to job applications and salary negotiations.

      9. How to Win Friends and Influence People <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Dale Carnegie </span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      Originally published in 1936, the lessons of Dale Carnegie’s classic
      self-help book still ring true to this day. No matter if you’re in high
      school, college or at any stage of your career, understanding how to
      connect with other people is one of the greatest lessons you can learn.
      This book will teach you how to navigate relationships, have meaningful
      conversations with anyone you talk to, and win over people who think
      differently to you. Especially in today’s world of online influencers
      and social media, it’s more important than ever to learn how to be
      influential in your career and social life.

      10. Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids about Money That
      the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! <br />
      <span class="book-blog-book-writer">by Robert T. Kiyosaki</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="book-blog-book-content">
      One of the most neglected areas in the traditional schooling system is
      financial education. According to a 2016 study, nearly two thirds of
      Americans are financially illiterate, meaning they can’t answer simple
      questions about money, debt and investing. <br /><br />

      In <i>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</i>Kiyosaki shares his experience growing up
      with two father figures who had virtually opposing views on finances and
      money. Although both dads earned well, one managed to invest well and
      leave an inheritance for his kids, while the other struggled with money
      his whole life. Kiyosaki narrows down what he learned from his “rich
      dad” to six fundamental lessons about money that everybody should know.
      <br /><br />
      This book will transform the way you think about and handle money for
      the rest of your life.
